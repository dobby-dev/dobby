## 0.6.3

### Fixes

- determining latest versions from tags (#323)

## 0.6.2

### Features

- Allow running default workflows (those that would be created by`--generate`) with no `knope.toml` file. (#286)

## 0.6.1

### Features

- Support PEP621 in `pyproject.toml`. (#274)

## 0.6.0

### Breaking Changes

- `PrepareRelease` now `git add`s all modified files. (#267)

### Fixes

- Remote parsing in `--generate` (#268)

## 0.5.1

### Fixes

- Do not error on `--validate` or `--dry-run` when no release will be created for `PrepareRelease`. (#265)

## 0.5.0

### Breaking Changes

- `PrepareRelease` will now error if no version-altering changes are detected.

### Features

- Support limiting commits to scopes per package. (#262)
- Allow multiple defined packages, deprecate old `[[packages]]` syntax. (#257)

## 0.4.3

### Features

- `prerelease_label` can be set at runtime with `--prerelease-label` or `KNOPE_PRERELEASE_LABEL`. (#247)

## 0.4.2

### Features

- `PrepareRelease` will create a `changelog` file if it was missing. (#240)

### Fixes

### Fixes

- Tags were being processed backwards starting in 0.4.0 (#227)

## 0.4.0

### Breaking Changes

- Always read all commits from previous stable release tag—not from most recent tag. This tag must be in the format v<semantic_version> (e.g., v1.2.3). If your last tag does not match that format, add a new tag before running the new version of Knope.
- When creating GitHub releases, prefix the tag with `v` (e.g., `v1.2.3) as is the custom for most tools.

### Features

- Support reading commits from projects with no tags yet. (#225)
- Support pulling current version from tags. (#224)
- Allow the `Release` step to run without GitHub config—creating a tag on release. (#216)
- Support installs from cargo-binstall

### Fixes

## 0.3.0

### Breaking Changes

- `BumpVersion` and `PrepareRelease` now require setting a `[[packages]]` field in `knope.toml`. The path to a changelog file is no longer defined with `changelog_path` in the `PrepareRelease` step. Instead, it is set as `changelog` in `[[packages]]`.
