Error:   × Problem with workflow release

Error: step::invalid_pyproject (https://knope-dev.github.io/knope/config/packages.html#supported-formats-for-versioning)

  × The file pyproject.toml was an incorrect format
  help: knope expects the pyproject.toml file to have a
        `tool.poetry.version` or `project.version` property. If you use a
        different location for your version, please open an issue to add
        support.
