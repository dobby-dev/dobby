# Knope

A command line tool that happily completes the tasks which most developers find tedious.

## TL;DR

Put a `knope.toml` in your project which defines some workflows, then run them with `knope`. Check out the file by the same name in this project for an example, or [read the docs](https://knope-dev.github.io/knope/) for more info.
