# Knope

A command line tool that happily completes the tasks which most developers find tedious.

## What it does

If you're already using [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), Knope can probably automate bumping versions and creating releases for you. Try running a `knope release --dry-run` to see what it would do for your current project with no config.

Knope can do much more with some customization, [read the docs](https://knope-dev.github.io/knope/) for more info.
