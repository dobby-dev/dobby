# There is a new docs website

Check out <https://knope.tech/> to see the new docs, and please report any errors or gaps!
All error messages within Knope should be updated to point to the new docs.
If any are still pointed at GitHub pages (as of this version), that's a bug!

As part of this, you can also now install Knope through [Chocolatey and Homebrew](https://knope.tech/installation)!
