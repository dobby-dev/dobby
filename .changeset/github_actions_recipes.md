#### GitHub Actions Recipes

There's a [new section of the docs](https://knope-dev.github.io/knope/github_actions/github_actions.html) with some recipes for using Knope in GitHub Actions. If you have suggestions for additional recipes, please open a [discussion](https://github.com/knope-dev/knope/discussions)!
