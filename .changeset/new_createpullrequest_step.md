#### New `CreatePullRequest` step

The new [`CreatePullRequest` step] allows you to create or update a pull request on GitHub. It's designed to be a nice way to preview and accept new releases via a pull request workflow, but could certainly work for more contexts as well! To see an example of the new PR-based release workflow, check out [Knope's prepare-release workflow] and [Knope's release workflow].
