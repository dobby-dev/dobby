title: Variables
---

Some steps allow you to use variables in their configuration.
Typically, this allows for string substitution with some context that Knope has.
Variables are always configured by providing both the string that should be replaced and the name of the variable that
should replace it. For example, if you wanted to insert the current package
version into a command, you might provide a `{"version": "Version"}` variable config. This would replace any instance
of the string `version` with `Version`. If you wanted a bash-like syntax, you might use `{"$version": "Version"}`
insteadâ€”pick whatever works best for you.

## `Version`

`Version` will attempt to parse the current package version.

:::caution
This variable can only be used when a single `[package]` is configured, there is currently no equivalent for multi-package projects.
:::

## `ChangelogEntry`

`ChangelogEntry` is the content of the changelog (if any) for the version that is indicated by the [`Version`](#version) variable.

:::caution
This variable can only be used when a single `[package]` is configured, there is currently no equivalent for multi-package projects.

## `IssueBranch`

`IssueBranch` will provide the same branch name that the [`SwitchBranches`] step would produce. You must have already
selected an issue in this workflow using [`SelectJiraIssue`], [`SelectGitHubIssue`], or [`SelectIssueFromBranch`] before
using this variable.

[`SwitchBranches`]: /reference/config-file/steps/switch-branches
[`SelectJiraIssue`]: /reference/config-file/steps/select-jira-issue
[`SelectGitHubIssue`]: /reference/config-file/steps/select-github-issue
[`SelectIssueFromBranch`]: /reference/config-file/steps/select-issue-from-branch
