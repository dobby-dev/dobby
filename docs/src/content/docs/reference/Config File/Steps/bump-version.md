title: BumpVersion
---

Bump the version of all packages using a [Semantic Versioning] rule. At least one [package] must be defined for this step to operate on.

:::hint
It may be easier to select the appropriate version automatically based on recent changes.
Check out the [automating releases tutorial](/tutorials/releasing-basic-projects).
:::

## Fields

1. `rule`: The Semantic Versioning [rule](#rules) to use.
2. `label`: Only applicable to `Pre` `rule`. The pre-release label to use.

## Examples

### Single Package Pre-Release

```toml
[package]
versioned_files = ["Cargo.toml"]

[[workflows]]
name = "pre-release"

[[workflows.steps]]
type = "BumpVersion"
rule = "Pre"
label = "rc"
```

With this particular example, running `knope pre-release` would bump the version in `Cargo.toml` using the `pre` rule and the `rc` label.
So if the version _was_ `0.1.2-rc.0`, it would be bumped to `0.1.2-rc.1`.

### Multiple Packages

This step runs for each defined package independently.

```toml
[packages.knope]
versioned_files = ["knope/Cargo.toml"]

[packages.knope-utils]
versioned_files = ["knope-utils/Cargo.toml"]

[[workflows]]
name = "major"

[[workflows.steps]]
type = "BumpVersion"
rule = "Major"
```

In this example, running `knope major` would bump the version in `knope/Cargo.toml` and `knope-utils/Cargo.toml` using the "major" rule. If the versions in those files were `0.1.2` and `3.0.0` respectively, they would be bumped to `0.2.0` and `4.0.0` respectively.

## Rules

### `Major`

Increment the Major component of the semantic version and reset all other components (e.g. 1.2.3-rc.4 -> 2.0.0).

### `Minor`

Increment the Minor component of the semantic version and reset all lesser components (e.g. 1.2.3-rc.4 -> 1.3.0 ).

### `Patch`

Increment the Patch component of the semantic version and reset all lesser components (e.g. 1.2.3-rc.4 -> 1.2.4).

### `Pre`

Increment the pre-release component of the semantic version or add it if missing. You must also provide a `label` parameter to this rule which will determine the pre-release string used. For example, running this rule with the `label` `rc` would change "1.2.3-rc.4" to "1.2.3-rc.5" or "1.2.3" to "1.2.4-rc.0".

:::danger
Only a very specific pre-release format is supportedâ€”that is `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-LABEL.NUMBER`. For example, `1.2.3-rc.4` is supported, but `1.2.3-rc4` is not. `LABEL` must be specified via config or the `--prerelease-label` option in the CLI. `NUMBER` starts at 0 and increments each time the rule is applied.
:::

### Release

Remove the pre-release component of the semantic version (e.g. 1.2.3-rc.4 -> 1.2.3).

## Errors

This step will fail if any of the following are true:

1. A malformed version string is found while attempting to bump. Note that only a subset of [pre-release version formats](#pre) are supported.
2. No [package] is defined missing or invalid.
