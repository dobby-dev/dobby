This step will fail if any of the following are true:

1. knope cannot communicate with GitHub.
2. There is no [GitHub config] set.
3. User does not select an issue.

```toml
[[workflows]]
name = "Start some work"
    [[workflows.steps]]
    type = "SelectGitHubIssue"
    label = "selected"
```

[github config]: /reference/config-file/github
[`switchbranches`]: /reference/config-file/steps/switch-branches
