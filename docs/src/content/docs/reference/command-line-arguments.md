title: Command Line Arguments
---

## Workflow

Only a single positional argument (one which does not begin with `-`) can be passed to Knope,
and it must be the name of a defined workflow. `knope release` runs a workflow named release.

## Global Interrupts

If one of these arguments is passed to Knope, it will not run any workflows and ignore most other arguments.

### `--help`

Prints a message describing everything that Knope can do, including descriptions of other _available_ arguments.

If run _after_ a workflow name (e.g., `knope release --help`), information relevant to that workflow is printed.

### `--version`

Prints the version of `knope` and exits.

### `--generate`

Creates a `knope.toml` file then exits. Not available if a `knope.toml` file already exists.

### `--upgrade`

Updates the `knope.toml` file from any deprecated (but still supported) syntax to the equivalent newer syntax.
Cannot be used if no `knope.toml` file is present.

### `--validate`

Checks that the `knope.toml` file is valid. Cannot be used if there is no `knope.toml` file in the current directory.

## Workflow modifiers

Arguments that modify the behavior of a workflow, the workflow will still be run.

### `--verbose`

Print out more info at every step, aiding in debugging.

### `--dry-run`

Do not modify any files on disk, make any network calls, or call any external commands.
Instead, print out what _would_ be done without the `--dry-run` flag.

### `--prerelease-label`

Set or override a `prerelease_label` for any [`PrepareRelease`] step.
Can only be used with workflows that contain the [`PrepareRelease`] step (like the default `release` workflow)

You can also set this with the [`KNOPE_PRERELEASE_LABEL`](/reference/environment-variables#knope_prerelease_label) environment variable.
This option takes precedence over that.

### `override-version`

Manually set a version for all [`BumpVersion`] and [`PrepareRelease`] steps instead of using semantic rules.
Can only be used with workflows that contain one of those steps, like the built in `release` workflow.

If the [single-package syntax] is used, provide a single semantic version, like `--override-version 1.0.0`.

If the [multi-package syntax] is used (even if only one package is configured with it),
you must specify the name of each package that should be overridden.
This option can also be provided more than once.
For example, `--override-version first-package=1.0.0 --override-version second-package=2.0.0`
will set the version of `first-package` to 1.0.0 and `second-package` to 2.0.0,
producing an error if either of those packages is not configured.
