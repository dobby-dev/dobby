title: ChangeSet
---

A set of [change files][change file] in the `.changeset` directory.
When creating a release,
every [change file] in the changeset is combined (along with any [conventional commits])
to generate the changelog and determine the next version for each [package].

Check out these tutorials for hands-on experience with changesets:

- [Releasing basic projects](/tutorials/releasing-basic-projects)
- [Releasing multiple packages](/tutorials/releasing-multiple-packages)

:::note
Changesets are based on the NodeJS-oriented [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)
and are designed to be compatible if you are migrating from that project.
There are a few differences between the twoâ€”notably,
this project does not require a `.changeset/config.json` nor a `package.json` file
(it works for all languages, not just JavaScript).

For more on the differences, check out the [Rust changesets docs](https://github.com/knope-dev/changesets)
