title: "Conventional commits"

import { TabItem, Tabs } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Knope supports a subset of [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/),
a way of encoding changelog & version information into commit messages.
This document describes how conventional commits work _in Knope_, not the full scope of the larger project.

## The first line

Every conventional commit must start with a type,
followed by an optional scope, then an optional exclamation point, then a colon, then a space, then a summary of the change.

```text
<type>[optional scope][!]: <summary>
```

Any commit without a first line structured like the above is not a conventional commit.

### Examples of valid first lines

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Basic">
    <code>feat: add a new feature</code>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="With scope">
    <code>feat(parser): add a new feature</code>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="With exclamation point">
    <code>feat!: add a new feature</code>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="With scope and exclamation point">
    <code>feat!(parser): add a new feature</code>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Special types

If the `type` of the conventional commit is `feat`, the change is a minor change
(for the purposes of [semantic versioning](/reference/concepts/semantic-versioning)) and the summary will be added to the "Features"
section of the changelog.
If the type is `fix`, the change is a patch change and the summary will be added to the "Fixes" section of the changelog.

Every other type is ignored, and will have no impact on the changelog or versioning.
However, the commit will still be considered a conventional commit, so the footers will be checked.

### Exclamation point

If the first line of the commit has an exclamation point right before the colon,
the commit is a major change and the summary will be added to the "Breaking changes"
section of the changelog.
This is **regardless of the type of the commit**.

### Scopes

A scope can be added immediately after the type within parentheses.
The commit message `feat(parser): add a new feature` has a scope of `parser`.
Scopes can be used to limit the impact of a change in multi-package repositories.
See the [releasing multiple packages tutorial](/tutorials/releasing-multiple-packages) for more information.

## The body

After the first line, every line is considered part of the body _until_ the first footer is encountered. Knope ignores commit bodies.

## Footers

A footer has the format `<key>: <value>`.
You can have as many footers as you want, one per line.
By default, Knope only checks for these footers:

`BREAKING CHANGE`: If this footer is present, the major component of the next semantic version should be incremented.
The `<value>` will be added to the "Breaking Changes" section of the changelog.

`Changelog-Note`: The `<value>` will be added to the "Notes" section of the changelog, for semantic versioning purposes
this is considered a patch change.

You can also use custom footers to add info to custom changelog sections,
see the [recipes on customizing the changelog](/recipes/customizing-changelogs) for more info.

## Full example

```text
feat(parser)!: Add a new feature

This is the body

and so it will be ignored

BREAKING CHANGE: Another breaking change
Changelog-Note: A note
```

Here we have a `feat` type, with a scope of `parser`, and an exclamation point. There are two footers: `BREAKING CHANGE`
with the value of "Another breaking change" and `Changelog-Note` with the value of "A note".

Because of the exclamantion point, "Add a new feature" will be put in the "Breaking Changes" section of the changelog.
If that exclamation point was not there, it would be put in the "Features" section of the changelog.

The `parser` scope will limit _all_ of these changes
(including the footers) to packages which have a `parser` scope and packages which have _no_ scopes (equivalent to all).

The "Another breaking change" footer will be added to the "Breaking Changes" section of the changelog,

The "A note" footer will be added to the "Notes" section of the changelog.
