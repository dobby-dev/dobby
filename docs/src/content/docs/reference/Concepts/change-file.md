title: Change File
---

A "change file"
is a specially formatted Markdown file
used both to decide the next version of your project and to generate a changelog.
Change files are in the `.changeset` directory,
the complete collection of those files is a [changeset](/reference/concepts/changeset).

You can create a change file with the [`CreateChangeFile`] step.
More info about the change file format is in the [changesets docs](https://github.com/knope-dev/changesets).
