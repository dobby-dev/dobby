title: "Releasing basic projects"
description: Learn how to document changes, update the changelog, and bump package versions
---

This tutorial will take you step by step through the process of:

1. Documenting changes to a package
2. Adding those changes to a changelog
3. Updating version numbers
4. Creating releases on GitHub

:::note

This tutorial creates a new Git repository with a single package.
The [monorepo tutorial](/tutorials/releasing-multiple-packages) covers automating releases for multiple packages in a single Git repository.

:::

## Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): The `git` CLI must be available in your terminal.
  It is helpful if you know the basics of commits and tags.
- A text editor: We'll be editing Markdown and JSON files. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a good free choice.
- Familiarity with a command line terminal, like "Terminal" on macOS or "PowerShell" Windows
- A [GitHub](https://github.com) account (you can use an alternative, but the results will be different)
- [Install Knope](/installation)

## Creating a project

Create a new empty directory wherever you like and open it in your terminal.

```sh
mkdir knope-tutorial  # create a new directory
cd knope-tutorial     # change into the new directory
```

Initialize a Git repository:

```sh
git init
```

Now open the directory in your text editor and create two files:

```md title="CHANGELOG.md"
# Changelog

This is where the changes in each release are documented.
```

```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "pizza-builder",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

We're simulating a JavaScript package—in a real package you'd have a lot more info in your `package.json` file,
but `version` is all that Knope needs.
Our package is starting at version `1.0.0`,
as we make changes, the version will increase depending on the type of change.

:::note
Knope supports [many package formats for many languages](../reference/config/versioned_files).
:::

Before we start making changes, we need somewhere to keep our releases.
Let's create a GitHub repository.
We're going to use the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/),
but if you have another method you prefer, feel free to use that instead.

```sh
gh repo create --private knope-tutorial --source .
```

## Little changes

Let's start by documenting a small change using a [conventional commit].

```sh
git commit --allow-empty -m "fix: No longer crashes when you add pineapple"
```

We've just documented a bug fix using a commit message!

:::note
In the real world, this commit would also include the relevant code changes.
:::

Let's see what Knope will do to our project when we next release it:

```sh
knope release --dry-run
```

<details>
    <summary>Example output from Knope</summary>

```text
Would add the following to package.json: 1.0.1
Would add the following to CHANGELOG.md:
## 1.0.1 (2023-11-01)

### Fixes

#### No longer crashes when you add pineapple

Would add files to git:
package.json
CHANGELOG.md
Would run git commit -m "chore: prepare release 1.0.1" && git push
Would create a release on GitHub with name 1.0.1 (2023-11-01) and tag v1.0.1 and body:

## Fixes

### No longer crashes when you add pineapple

```

</details>

:::tip
That `--dry-run` flag can be used anywhere in Knope to see what _would_ happen without actually doing it.
:::

According to that output Knope will:

1. Set the version of our package in `package.json` to `1.0.1`
2. Add a new section to `CHANGELOG.md` with the changes we've made
3. Commit those changes to Git and push to our remote repo
4. Create a new release on GitHub

Let's try it for real!

## Creating a release

If we run the `release` workflow again without the `--dry-run` option, Knope will do everything it promised to.

```sh
knope release
```

```
? No GitHub token found, generate one from https://github.com/settings/tokens with `repo` permissions and input here
```

Knope wants to create that GitHub release, but it needs access to GitHub!
Go ahead and generate one with the link it provided, then paste it into your terminal.

:::note
Knope will write this token to a file to store for later use (where depends on your operating system).
If you don't want to store the token, you can set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable instead.
:::

Now that the workflow has complete, our `package.json` has the new version number:

```json title="package.json" {3}
{
  "name": "pizza-builder",
  "version": "1.0.1"
}
```

Our `CHANGELOG.md` contains the message from our commit:

```md title="CHANGELOG.md" {5-9}
# Changelog

This is where the changes in each release are documented.

## 1.0.1 (2023-11-01)

### Fixes

#### No longer crashes when you add pineapple
```

And that same content is in a new GitHub release:

```sh
gh release view --web
```

![GitHub release](./release_1.0.1.png)

## More complex changes

[Conventional commits] are great for simple changes, you just start your commit with `fix: ` or `feat: `.
For changes that take more than a few words to describe, though, we'll turn to [changesets].

Let's document a new feature for our package:

```sh
knope document-change
```

You'll get a choice of the _type_ of change.
The terms are from [semantic versioning], so `minor` is what we want for a new feature:

```
? What type of change is this?
  major
> minor
  patch
[↑↓ to move, enter to select, type to filter]
```

After selecting `minor` with the enter key, we can summarize our new feature:

```
> What type of change is this? minor
? What is a short summary of this change? Add calzones
[This will be used as a header in the changelog]
```

This created a new Markdown file for us which we can fill in with more details:

```md title=".changeset/add_calzones.md" ins={6-9}
---
default: minor
---

# Add calzones

In addition to building Pizzas, you can now build calzones! Just use the new `--calzone` option!

> Pizza? Never heard of it. That's what people will be saying in 20 years, because pizza is old news. Pizza is your grandfather's calzone.
```

We can also add a conventional commit into the same release:

```sh
git commit --allow-empty -m 'feat: Added the `olives` topping'
```

Let's do a dry run to see what Knope will do:

```sh
knope release --dry-run
```

<details>
    <summary>Example output from Knope</summary>

```text {16-18,37-39}
Would delete: .changeset/add_calzones.md
Would add the following to package.json: 1.1.0
Would add the following to CHANGELOG.md:
## 1.1.0 (2023-11-02)

### Features

#### Added the `olives` topping

### Fixes

CHANGELOG.md
.changeset/add_calzones.md
Would run git commit -m "chore: prepare release 1.1.0" && git push

```

</details>

Uh oh, our fix from the _last_ version is being included again!
That's because Knope uses Git tags to figure out which conventional commits to include in a release.
The release was created on GitHub, but we don't have that tag locally! Let's fix that, then try again:

```sh
git pull --tags
knope release --dry-run
```

<details>
    <summary>Example output from Knope</summary>

```text
Would delete: .changeset/add_calzones.md
Would add the following to package.json: 1.1.0
Would add the following to CHANGELOG.md:
## 1.1.0 (2023-11-02)

.changeset/add_calzones.md
Would run git commit -m "chore: prepare release 1.1.0" && git push

```

</details>

Much better!
Now that Knope knows _when_ `1.0.1` was, it can properly ignore the changes from that release.
Let's go ahead and create this release for real:

```sh
knope release
gh release view --web
```

![GitHub release](./release_1.1.0.png)

Now we can see one of the big advantages to changesets,
we can have as much Markdown content as we need to describe a change.
You can imagine sample code snippets, screenshots, even collapsible sections!

## Finishing up

You've done it!
You documented both simple changes (with conventional commits)
and complex changes (with changesets).
Then, you released them by updating the changelog, bumping the version,
and creating a GitHub release, all with a single command!

You already have the basic skills necessary to start speeding up your release processes,
but you can take it a step further by [releasing in GitHub Actions](../recipes/github-actions-pr).

:::tip
Don't forget to clean up your GitHub repository when you're done:

```sh
gh repo delete knope-tutorial
```
