title: Releasing multiple packages
description: Automating releases for repositories with multiple packages
---

Sometimes you have more than one package in a repository, commonly called a monorepo.
This tutorial will show you how to:

1. Create a Knope config file
2. Document changes that only impact _some_ packages
3. Document changes that impact _all_ packages

:::tip
A package is a collection of files with _one version_ that you will release together.
You can have many versioned files in a single package,
for example, you may release a package to both crates.io and PyPI using
a `Cargo.toml` and a `pyproject.toml`.
For this pattern, check out the [multiple versioned files recipe](/recipes/multiple-versioned-files).
:::

## Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): The `git` CLI must be available in your terminal.
  It's helpful if you know the basics of commits and tags.
- A text editor: You'll be editing Markdown and TOML files. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a good free choice.
- Familiarity with a command line terminal, like "Terminal" on macOS or "PowerShell" Windows
- A [GitHub](https://github.com) account (you can use an alternative, but the results will be different)
- [Install Knope](/installation)

## Create a new Git repo

Start by creating a new directory, moving into it, and initializing a Git repository.

```shell
mkdir knope-tutorial
cd knope-tutorial
git init
```

This repo will eventually need to be on GitHub so Knope can create releases for it.
You can do that with the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/):

```shell
gh repo create --private knope-tutorial --source .
```

## Create a Knope config file

Knope requires a [config file](/reference/config-file/packages) to support multiple packages:

```shell
knope --generate
```

The default `knope.toml` file is for a single package, it needs some tweaks to support multiple packages.
Open it up in your editor and remove the `[package]` section, then add three `[packages]` sections:

```toml title="knope.toml" del={1} ins={2-6}
[package]
[packages.pizza]

[packages.toppings]

[packages.calzone]
```

## Set up the monorepo

Each package should have some versioned files and a changelog.
Knope supports [many file formats](/reference/config-file/packages#versioned_files), like `Cargo.toml` files:

```toml title="knope.toml" ins={2-3,6-7,10-11}
[packages.pizza]
versioned_files = ["pizza/Cargo.toml"]
changelog = "pizza/CHANGELOG.md"

[packages.toppings]
versioned_files = ["toppings/Cargo.toml"]
changelog = "toppings/CHANGELOG.md"

[packages.calzone]
versioned_files = ["calzone/Cargo.toml"]
changelog = "calzone/CHANGELOG.md"
```

Those files must exist as well:

```toml title="pizza/Cargo.toml"
[package]
version = "3.14.15"
```

```md title="pizza/CHANGELOG.md"
# Pizza Changelog

Documenting everything new in the world of Pizza.
```

```toml title="toppings/Cargo.toml"
[package]
version = "1.209.0"
```

```md title="toppings/CHANGELOG.md"
# Toppings Changelog

New toppings are added here
```

```toml title="calzone/Cargo.toml"
[package]
version = "0.14.2"
```

```md title="calzone/CHANGELOG.md"
# Calzone Changelog
```

Commit this to serve as a baseline for the rest of the tutorial:

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "Initial setup"
```

## Some monorepo limitations

Knope will report any problems with the config file:

```shell
knope --validate
```

You should see an error like this:

```text
Error:   × There are problems with the defined workflows

Error:   × Problem with workflow release

Error: variables::too_many_packages

  × Too many packages defined
  help: The Version variable in a Command step can only be used with a single [package].
```

There's a bit more work to do to convert this to a monorepo.
Multi-package setups have some extra limitations at the time of writing.
For example, multi-package configs can't use the `Version` variable:

```toml title="knope.toml" del={4-6} del=" $version"
[[workflows.steps]]
type = "Command"
command = "git commit -m \"chore: prepare release $version\" && git push"

[workflows.steps.variables]
"$version" = "Version"
```

```shell
knope --validate
```

If everything is correct, you'll see no output.

<details>
<summary>Full `knope.toml` at this stage</summary>

The only difference between this `knope.toml` and yours should be the `[github]` section at the bottom.

```toml title="knope.toml"
[packages.pizza]
versioned_files = ["pizza/Cargo.toml"]
changelog = "pizza/CHANGELOG.md"

[packages.toppings]
versioned_files = ["toppings/Cargo.toml"]
changelog = "toppings/CHANGELOG.md"

[packages.calzone]
versioned_files = ["calzone/Cargo.toml"]
changelog = "calzone/CHANGELOG.md"

[[workflows]]
name = "release"

[[workflows.steps]]
type = "PrepareRelease"

[[workflows.steps]]
type = "Command"
command = "git commit -m \"chore: prepare release\" && git push"

[[workflows.steps]]
type = "Release"

[[workflows]]
name = "document-change"

[[workflows.steps]]
type = "CreateChangeFile"

[github]
owner = "dbanty"
repo = "knope-tutorial"
```

</details>

## Documenting changes

As with a single package,
you can document changes
with either [changesets](/reference/concepts/changeset) or [conventional commits](/reference/concepts/conventional-commits).

### Changesets

```shell
knope document-change
```

:::tip
That `document-change` command comes from the workflow in `knope.toml` with the same name, go check it out!
:::

Knope will ask which packages the change impacts:

```text
? Which packages does this change affect?
> [ ] pizza
  [ ] toppings
  [ ] calzone
[↑↓ to move, space to select one, → to all, ← to none, type to filter]
```

Use the arrow keys and space bar to select `pizza` and `calzone`, then press enter.
Next, select `patch` as the change type for each (they're in order):

```text
> Which packages does this change affect? pizza, calzone
> What type of change is this? patch
? What type of change is this?
  major
  minor
> patch
[↑↓ to move, enter to select, type to filter]
```

Finally, summarize the change:

```text
> Which packages does this change affect? pizza, calzone
> What type of change is this? patch
> What type of change is this? patch
? What is a short summary of this change? The cheese is now distributed more evenly
[This will be used as a header in the changelog]
```

This will create a change file that looks like this:

```md title=".changeset/the_cheese_is_now_distributed_more_evenly.md"
---
calzone: patch
pizza: patch
---

# The cheese is now distributed more evenly
```

It includes the name of each package that the change impacts,
the type of change for each of those packages, and the summary.
At this point,
you could add as much Markdown as you want to the bottom of the file to describe the change more fully.

Knope can show you a preview of the upcoming release:

```shell
knope release --dry-run
```

```text

```

Knope updates the versions and changelogs of each package independently.
Because there are no changes to `toppings`, nothing will happen to it.

:::caution
Note the Git tag format, it's `<package name>/v<version>`. This differs from the single-package format of `v<version>`.
:::

### Conventional commits

Changesets work great for monorepos by default, but conventional commits require a bit more care.
A basic conventional commit will apply to all packages:

```shell
rm .changeset/the_cheese_is_now_distributed_more_evenly.md  # Revert changeset
git commit --allow-empty -m "fix: The cheese is now distributed more evenly"  # create basic conventional commit
knope release --dry-run  # See what Knope would do with it
```

```text
Would add the following to pizza/Cargo.toml: 3.14.16
Would add the following to pizza/CHANGELOG.md:
## 3.14.16 (2023-11-11)

### Fixes

#### The cheese is now distributed more evenly

Would add files to git:
  pizza/Cargo.toml
  pizza/CHANGELOG.md
Would add the following to toppings/Cargo.toml: 1.209.1
Would add the following to toppings/CHANGELOG.md:

### Fixes

#### The cheese is now distributed more evenly

Would add files to git:
  toppings/Cargo.toml
  toppings/CHANGELOG.md
Would add the following to calzone/Cargo.toml: 0.14.3
Would add the following to calzone/CHANGELOG.md:
## 0.14.3 (2023-11-11)

### Fixes

#### The cheese is now distributed more evenly

Would add files to git:
  calzone/Cargo.toml
  calzone/CHANGELOG.md
Would run git commit -m "chore: prepare release" && git push
Would create a release on GitHub with name pizza 3.14.16 (2023-11-11) and tag pizza/v3.14.16 and body:
## Fixes

### The cheese is now distributed more evenly
Would create a release on GitHub with name toppings 1.209.1 (2023-11-11) and tag toppings/v1.209.1 and body:
## Fixes

### The cheese is now distributed more evenly
Would create a release on GitHub with name calzone 0.14.3 (2023-11-11) and tag calzone/v0.14.3 and body:
## Fixes

### The cheese is now distributed more evenly
```

You can limit commits to _specific_ packages using scopes:

```toml title="knope.toml" ins={4,13}
[packages.pizza]
versioned_files = ["pizza/Cargo.toml"]
changelog = "pizza/CHANGELOG.md"
scopes = ["pizza"]

[packages.toppings]
versioned_files = ["toppings/Cargo.toml"]
changelog = "toppings/CHANGELOG.md"

[packages.calzone]
versioned_files = ["calzone/Cargo.toml"]
changelog = "calzone/CHANGELOG.md"
scopes = ["calzone"]
```

Now, conventional commits which have the `pizza` scope will only affect the `pizza` package,
and `calzone` commits will only affect the `calzone` package.
Commits _without_ scopes (like the one you just created) will still affect all packages,
you can verify that with `knope release --dry-run` again.

It's _possible_ to recreate the changeset results using _two_ commits:

:::caution
Don't do this, it's just for demonstration, there's a better way!

```shell
git commit --allow-empty -m "fix(pizza): The cheese is now distributed more evenly"
git commit --allow-empty -m "fix(calzone): The cheese is now distributed more evenly"
```

:::

But the _point_ of conventional commits is to document the changes made _within_ the commit,
so one change should be in one commit, not two.
It's better to have a new scope that impacts _both_ packages:

```toml title="knope.toml" ins={4,13}
[packages.pizza]
versioned_files = ["pizza/Cargo.toml"]
changelog = "pizza/CHANGELOG.md"
scopes = ["pizza", "pizza-and-calzone"]

[packages.toppings]
versioned_files = ["toppings/Cargo.toml"]
changelog = "toppings/CHANGELOG.md"

[packages.calzone]
versioned_files = ["calzone/Cargo.toml"]
changelog = "calzone/CHANGELOG.md"
scopes = ["calzone", "pizza-and-calzone"]
```

Now a single commit can impact both `pizza` and `calzone`, without impacting `toppings`:

```shell
git reset HEAD~  # undo the unscoped commit
git commit --allow-empty -m "fix(pizza-and-calzone): The cheese is now distributed more evenly"
```

```shell
knope release --dry-run
```

```text
Would add the following to pizza/Cargo.toml: 3.14.16
Would add the following to pizza/CHANGELOG.md:
## 3.14.16 (2023-11-11)

### Fixes

#### The cheese is now distributed more evenly

Would add files to git:
  pizza/Cargo.toml
  pizza/CHANGELOG.md
Would add the following to calzone/Cargo.toml: 0.14.3
Would add the following to calzone/CHANGELOG.md:
## 0.14.3 (2023-11-11)

### Fixes

#### The cheese is now distributed more evenly

Would add files to git:
  calzone/Cargo.toml
  calzone/CHANGELOG.md
Would run git commit -m "chore: prepare release" && git push
Would create a release on GitHub with name pizza 3.14.16 (2023-11-11) and tag pizza/v3.14.16 and body:
## Fixes

### The cheese is now distributed more evenly
Would create a release on GitHub with name calzone 0.14.3 (2023-11-11) and tag calzone/v0.14.3 and body:
## Fixes

### The cheese is now distributed more evenly
```

This is the same result as the changeset, but with a single commit message instead.

:::tip
Use conventional commits sparingly, for simple changes only.
Usually, a change that impacts multiple packages is worth documenting more thoroughly with a changeset.
:::

:::caution
The next step will save GitHub credentials to a file on your computer.
If you don't want that, you can instead set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to the token.
:::

Time to try it out for real:

```shell
knope release
```

If you don't have a GitHub token set, Knope will prompt you to create one and paste it into the terminal.
Once you do, you'll see some output from Git.
If there are no errors, your releases should exist!

Open your repo in GitHub (you can use `gh repo view --web`), and click on "Releases" on the side.
You should see something like this:

![GitHub releases](./github-monorepo-releases.png)

Knope creates one release on GitHub per package so that it's easy for consumers to see
what's changed in only the packages they care about!

## Wrapping up

In this tutorial, you:

1. Configured Knope for a monorepo
2. Documented changes using both changesets and conventional commits
3. Created GitHub releases for each package

Next up, you should consider [using GitHub Actions to automate releases](/recipes/preview-releases-with-pull-requests).

:::note
Don't forget to clean up your GitHub repo!

```shell
gh repo delete knope-tutorial
```
