# GitHub

Details needed to use steps that reference GitHub repos.

## Example

```TOML
# dobby.toml

[github]
owner = "triaxtec"
repo = "dobby"
```

The first time you use a step which requires this config, you will be prompted to generate a GitHub API token so Dobby can perform actions on you behalf.
