# Installation

## Install via Cargo (Recommended)

Knope is written in Rust and published on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/knope) which means it can therefore be installed by:

1. Installing cargo via [Rustup]
1. Running `cargo install knope`

## Install from Source

1. Install the current Rust stable toolchain via [Rustup]
1. Clone [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/knope-dev/knope/)
1. `cargo install --path .` in the cloned directory

## Download a Binary

We automatically build binaries for some platforms which can be found on the [Releases](https://github.com/knope-dev/knope/releases) page.

## Other
