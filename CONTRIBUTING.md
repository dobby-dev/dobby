# Contributing

Knope is open to all kinds of contributionsâ€”if you want to contribute code there are a few helpful hints.

## Docs

The [docs website](https://knope.tech) is built using [starlight](https://starlight.astro.build).
The source is contained in the `docs` directory.
The easiest way to find a document to edit is to go to that doc on the website and click on "Edit page"
at the bottom.

### Running locally

`npm --prefix docs install`, then `npm --prefix docs start` (or `just serve-docs`).

### Docs linting

CI will fail if the docs are not formatted correctly or there are broken relative links.
Use `just reformat` to reformat the docs and `just build-docs` to check for broken links.

## `just` and `justfile`

[`just`](https://just.systems/man/en/chapter_1.html) is a command runner (like `make`) which makes it easier to run
common tasks the same way in multiple platforms. Specifically, you can run the same sorts of commands that CI does to
replicate failures (or prevent them) locally! Start by installing
via [your favorite method](https://just.systems/man/en/chapter_4.html) (personally, I
use [`cargo binstall just`][cargo-binstall]). Then, run `just -l` to see all the available commands.

## Formatting

We use `rustfmt` to format Rust code, but we depend on unstable features (e.g., sorting imports). You need to install
the nightly toolchain (e.g., `rustup toolchain install nightly`) before formatting the code.

We also use [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to format Markdown (via [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npx))
and [Taplo](https://crates.io/crates/taplo-cli) for formatting TOML. `just install-all-dependencies` will install
Taplo (via [cargo-binstall], which must be installed separately), but will not install NPM.

## Snapshot Tests

Most of the tests for Knope are end-to-end snapshot tests in the `tests` directory, where one directory/module
corresponds to one test.
To create a new test:

1. Copy a test directory
2. Add it as a `mod` to whatever directory is above it.
3. Modify the contents of `in` as required for what you're testing. This directory will be copied, and `knope` will be
   run within it.
4. Modify the contents of `out` to match what `in` should look like after running the command (e.g., increased versions)
5. Modify `mod.rs` to have the setup & command invocation that you want
6. Run the test with `just` (or `cargo test`)
7. If the test fails, you can run `SNAPSHOTS=overwrite just` to update the snapshots

### How snapshot tests work

Generally, the code of a snapshot test looks like this

```rust
#[test]
fn name_of_test() {
    TestCase::new(file!())  // Corresponds to a directory you make for this test
        .git(&[              // Run Git commands as needed to set up the test
            Commit("Initial commit"),
            Tag("v0.1.0"),
        ])
        .env("KNOPE_PRERELEASE_LABEL", "alpha")  // Set environment variables as needed
        .run("prepare-release --prerelease-label alpha")  // The command you want to run, omitting the binary name
}
```

This test is expected to be defined within a "test directory," which contains the following:

1. An `in` directory with all the files that the command needs to run.
   These will be copied to a temporary
   directory.
2. An `out` directory, if the command should alter the files in `in`.
3. A `stdout.log` file if the command is expected to succeed and produce an output.
4. A `dry_run_stdout.log` file if the command should also be run with `--dry-run` to snapshot the output.
5. A `stderr.log` file if the command is expected to fail and produce an error message.

If neither of `stdout.log` or `stderr.log` are present, the test is expected to succeed and produce no output.

`TestCase` leverages [snapbox](https://crates.io/crates/snapbox) under the hood, so you can set `SNAPSHOTS=overwrite` to
update the snapshots if you've made changes to the test.

The setup functions (`new`, `git`, `env`) of `TestCase` are `const`,
so you can define them once and reuse them in multiple cases,
when slightly different setups should produce the same results
(for example, in `tests/prepare_release/override_prerelease_label/mod.rs`).
