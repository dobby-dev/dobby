# Contributing

Knope is open to all kinds of contributionsâ€”if you want to contribute code there are a few helpful hints.

## cargo-make

We use [`cargo-make`](https://sagiegurari.github.io/cargo-make/) to make running some development tasks easier. You do not _need_ `cargo-make`, but it is recommended. Here are the common tasks you'll want to run:

1. `cargo make` will run all the development tasks, reformatting code, linting, and running tests.
2. `cargo make serve-book` builds the docs, watches for changes, and starts a local webserver to view them.
3. `cargo make ci-flow` will run _most_ of what CI does, excluding building the docs and checking formatting.
4. `cargo make check-format` checks the formatting of the code the same way that CI will.

## Formatting

We use `rustfmt` to format Rust code, but we depend on unstable features (e.g., sorting imports). You need to install the nightly toolchain (e.g., `rustup toolchain install nightly`) before formatting the code.

We also use [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to format Markdown (via [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npx)) and [Taplo](https://crates.io/crates/taplo-cli) for formatting TOML. Taplo will be installed automatically if using `cargo-make`, but `npx` must be available to run Prettier.

## Snapshot Tests

We use [snapbox](https://crates.io/crates/snapbox) for most of the integration tests in the `tests` dir. This allows us to run commands end-to-end and compare the output to what we expect (making it much clearer when things change).

The general workflow for a snapshot test is:

1. Create a new directory in `tests` (optionally nested in a subdirectory relevant to what you're testing) which contains all the setup files you need (e.g., a `knope.toml` and a `Cargo.toml`).
2. Create a temp directory and copy all the source files over.
3. Use the functions from `tests/git_repo_helpers` to set up a git repo and add any commits/tags you need (for testing releases).
4. Run the command and verify the output using snapbox.

A good example of this is the `prerelease_after_release` test in `tests/prepare_release.rs`.
